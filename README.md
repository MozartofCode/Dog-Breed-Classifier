# Dog-Breed-Classifier

This is a simple Dog Breed Classifier where given the picture of a dog, the application figures out what the breed of the dog is
based on a pretrained CNN model and then using an API, gets basic information about that breed of dog like average life expectancy, playfulness etc.

Unfortunately, the model I have found proved to be not quite accurate, at least with the photos I have tested, so at some point I want
to look into creating my own model where I have better accuracy of predictions.
